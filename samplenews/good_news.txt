Intel, Citigroup, and Markwest Energy Partners LP were among the most dominant stocks in the options pits on Monday, as traders snapped up calls by the armload ahead of the companies’ respective ex-dividend dates. Intel and Markwest Energy trade ex-div today, with INTC shareholders at the close eligible for a dividend of 24 cents per share, while MWE shareholders are eligible for a dividend of 91 cents per share. Citigroup’s ex-div date isn’t until May 7, with shareholders looking at a dividend payout of 20 cents per share.

As expected, all three stocks saw extremely heavy call volume as options traders employ dividend capture strategies to take advantage of the situation. Overall, MWE was the most pronounced recipient of call volume, with nearly 100% of yesterday’s options activity trading as calls for the stock.
